API - interface to a server that has data or performs actions
Postman helps in the management and development of APIs
Installation notes
    It has dark mode!!

Working with APIs in Postman
    When working with a specific API make sure to look at the docs
    Collections - a list of requests, usually all connected to the API
        After making a collection an API, add all the requests with the same API to to the collection
    Variables - values such as the base url can be set as variables with a global or collection scope
        Highlight the text to save in a variable and hit 'set as variable'
        Variables are called using '{{variableNameHere}}'
        To see pre-set postman variables, use {{$variableName}}
            When the $ is typed in, a list of variables will appear to be selected
        Environment and global variables can also be added
    Make sure to save the requests after editing them

Parameters
    Query parameters - options that can be added to the request to get specific results
        Can be required or optional depending on API
    Path variables - a different way to send options
        Usage is based on specific API

When trying to post a json, js, html, xml, or text body, go to Body > raw > and select the specific format from the 'Text' dropdown
    The format and information that needs to be sent depends on the API

When using an access token for an API, it helps to add it as a variable
    To add/edit variables go to the collection settings
    To add token as a header go to the 'Authorization' tab

View logs and traffic in the console

To test the API and scripting, go to the 'Tests' tab
    Scripting in JS, and snippits are provided
    Adding code to 'Tests' allows postman to understand what's going on
    All code for extracting/manipulating data goes here

Tests in postman start with "pm.test()" and takes 2 parameters: the test name and a function to run for the test
    Look at the snippets for specific syntax
